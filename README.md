# He-Zhang-Jungle_noNet
It's an uncompleted and no net-connection demo.
And it's just a game of the Jungle with poor UI.
This game is called "Dou Shou Qi" in Chinese.

Here are basic rules:

There are eight types of chesses in the chessboard, from the strongest to weakest are
Elephant → Lion → Tiger → Leopard → Wolf → Dog → Cat → Rat.
The stronger can EAT the waeker, EXCEPT FOR that Rat can eat Elephant but Elephant cannot eat Rat.
The same type of chesses can eat each other.

There are TRAP cells besides DENS. When one player move a chess to his opponent's DEN or eat up all the enemies, he wins.
But when his chesses step in TRAPs, all chesses of his opponent can eat them.
All chess can move to adjacent cells for one time.

There are RIVER cells in chessboard.
Only Rat can step into RIVERs, but it can't step out and eat Elephant at the same time.
Only Lion and Tiger can jump across the RIVERs(toward straight line and to the nearest bank), and they can jump and eat what they can eat AT THE SAME TIME.
BUT when a Rat in RIVERs is in their way, they can't jump across the RIVERs.
